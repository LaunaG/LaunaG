## Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at the [University of Chicago Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/), where I partner with social impact organizations in domains like development finance, agricultural policy, and marine technologies to build custom data solutions with the support of the [11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org/). Prior to my current role, I worked for a Microsoft partner company and built  microservices to help a Fortune 1000 restaurant chain migrate 100 percent of its operations to Azure.

ðŸ”­ **I'm currently working on...**

Several exciting projects through the Institute, including:

- [ICONIC Oceans Data Hub](https://github.com/uchicago-dsi/miss-data-portal) with Minorities in Shark Sciences
- [Development Bank Investment Tracker (DeBIT)](https://github.com/uchicago-dsi/debit-scrapers) and [Shareholder Tracker](https://github.com/uchicago-dsi/debit-scrapers) with Inclusive Development International

ðŸŒ¯ **I've recently wrapped up...**

The following projects were successfully handed off:

- [Tax Credit Bonus Map](https://github.com/uchicago-dsi/climate-cabinet-tax-credit-map) with Climate Cabinet Education
- [Regulatory Submissions Data Pipeline](https://github.com/FracTrackerAlliance/fractracker-complaints) with FracTracker Alliace [Private]

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning...**

- Remix and UI/UX design through a course with Kent C. Dodds while I'm on a front-end kick.
- Next in the queue is a deeper dive into systems design.

âš¡ **Fun facts...**

- My first exposure to programming occurred in the 5th or 6th grade, when I stumbled across a ThinkQuest website allowing users to draw geometric shapes in Logo with a turtle icon.  It was fun and addictive! A precursor of things to come.
- I pivoted into tech from a nontraditional background in the humanities and am passionable about making the field more accessible and inclusive. One day, I am interested in exploring digital/computational humanities projects.
